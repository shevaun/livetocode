h2. If RSpec hangs while running a test

Look for cases where you have the subject followed by space should, e.g.

@specify { project should eq another_project }@

and replace the space with a full stop:

@specify { project.should eq another_project }@

This has happened to me twice now, and the first time it took ages to debug.
