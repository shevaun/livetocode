h2. GRoute

If you are sick of the time it takes to run @rake routes@ every time you want to inspect your routes or search for a particular one, check out this gem that my friend "Jordan Carter":http://wetware.co.nz/ wrote called "groute":https://github.com/jordandcarter/groute.

It caches your routes in a temporary file so that subsequent searches are lightning fast, and only regenerates the routes when they change.

h2. Usage

Install the gem

@$ gem install groute@

and use it like this

@$ groute products@

which is the same as doing

@$ rake routes | grep products@

but way faster!
