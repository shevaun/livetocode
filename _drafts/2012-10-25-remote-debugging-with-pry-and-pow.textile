I use Pow for running my Rack Apps on my dev machine and love it. However, recently I needed to use Pry to debug some weird behaviour I was seeing in my app.
Luckily, there's a gem called "pry-remote":https://github.com/Mon-Ouie/pry-remote which makes it dead easy to use Pry with Pow.

# Add the gem to your Gemfile 
@gem 'pry-remote'@
# Install it 
@bundle install@
# Add a debug statement to your code
@binding.remote_pry@ (instead of @binding.pry@)
# Finally, connect to your remote debugging session by typing 
@pry-remote@ into the terminal.
