Sometimes you want to be able to isolate a single test and run it independently of any other tests.

h2. Using Test::Unit

h3. Run a single test file

@ruby -I"lib:test" test/unit/file_load_test.rb@

h3. Run a single test within a file

@ruby -I"lib:test" test/unit/file_load_test.rb -n test_should_load_a_gz_file@

h2. Using RSpec

h3. Run a single test file

@rspec spec/models/transmission_outage_spec.rb --format doc@

h3. Run a single test within a file

@rspec spec/models/transmission_outage_spec.rb:56 --format doc@ 
_(where 56 is the line number of the test to be run)_
